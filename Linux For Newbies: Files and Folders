Linux for Newbies: Files and Folders 
------------------------------------

So I got a request from one of my faithful YouTube viewers, and he
wanted to know about the file structure and directory structure
behind linux. 

Thanks Aerofart for requesting the video!

Here is a quick summary of the various directories you will find
inside the Linux file system. I will include references to the
directories they are similar to in windows.

Directories

/ - Root directory
The root directory is like the trunk of a family-tree. It is the
beginning of everything. Even drives and devices are treated like
files in Linux

/home - Home Directory
The home directory is like the equivalent of the Documents and 
Settings directory on Windows where you will find the various users
and their associate files.

/root - Slash Root or Root Home
This is the home directory for the "root" user. In Linux, Root
is the same thing as the system-wide administrator in windows.

/etc - Sounds like Etsy
This is the file where most of your config files are going to be.
There are mostly text files and uninteresting unless you are 
messing with the repository references for your package manager
of choice

/dev - Device
This is where you find urandom and null, which are about the only 
two interesting things in that folder. these are devices, which 
can include your mouse or whatever drive

/mnt - Mount
These are devices that can be mounted and unmounted, like floppies
and other devices.

/tmp - Temp
Garbage file. Ask Joey.
