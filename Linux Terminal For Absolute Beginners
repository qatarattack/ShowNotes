Linux Terminal For Absolute Beginners!

This is a segment I've been wanting to do for a while! I know a lot 
of you want to get started with Linux, and this is my guide for the
most important part of Linux, and the biggest assett, the terminal!

In this video, we will cover the following commands, and maybe a few
more. I've already shot the video, so I'm mentioning these from
memory, so there could be more. Cat, LS, Ping, Ifconfig, Iwconfig,
apt-get, yum, CP, RM, Less, More, Grep, and I think I am forgetting
a few..

If you are unfamiliar with a command, there is something that I 
forgot to mention in the show, you can use what are called "man 
pages" to read the MANual on the tool if you have questions.

Use it like this:

$ man <command name>

example:

$ man ifconfig

This will bring up the manual page for whatever command you put in 
there. To exit the manual that pops up, use the "Q" button.

Thanks for watching! -James
